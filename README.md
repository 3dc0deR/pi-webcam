# Raspberry Pi Webcam

Inspired by David Hunt's blog post showing how to use a [Raspberry Pi Zero with a Pi Camera as a USB Webcam](http://www.davidhunt.ie/raspberry-pi-zero-with-pi-camera-as-usb-webcam/), I wanted to make my Raspberry Pi 4 do the same thing, but automated and with all the scripts wrapped in version control, since the blog post was a little bit vague in some areas.

This Ansible playbook can be run on a Raspberry Pi to set it up as a USB OTG webcam.

And I'm still working on the playbook. So check back later :)
